## Executive Summary

TaskForge is a functional project management application with solid core features including task management, Kanban boards, sprint planning, and workspace organization. However, several **critical and major issues** need attention before production use. The most significant problems are: broken file serving for attachments, missing Register page, recurring SSE connection errors, breadcrumb/heading showing generic names instead of actual entity names, and the Gantt view being a placeholder.

### Issue Counts by Severity

## Page-by-Page Audit Results

### 1. Landing Page (/)
**Status:** ✅ Working  
- Clean, professional design with gradient background
- Feature cards (Full Hierarchy, Sprint Planning, Self-Hosted) render correctly
- "Sign In" and "Get Started" links point to `/login`
- "View on GitHub" link points to repo
- Footer with MIT License

**Issues:**
- 🟡 **LAND-01** — "Sign up" link on login page points to `/register` which returns 404 (see AUTH-02)

---

### 2. Login/Auth Page (/login)
**Status:** ✅ Working (login works, registration broken)

- Email/password login works correctly
- Google and GitHub OAuth buttons present (visual only — OAuth not configured in demo)
- Successful login redirects to `/dashboard`

**Issues:**
| ID | Issue | Severity | Description |
|----|-------|----------|-------------|
| AUTH-01 | Login form works | ✅ | Credentials auth functional |
| AUTH-02 | Register page missing | 🔴 Critical | `/register` returns 404. Login page has "Don't have an account? Sign up" link pointing to `/register` but no page exists. Only an API endpoint `/api/auth/register` exists. |
| AUTH-03 | Google/GitHub OAuth | 🟡 Minor | OAuth buttons present but likely non-functional in demo (no OAuth provider configured). No error feedback if clicked and fails. |

---

### 3. Dashboard/Home (/dashboard)
**Status:** ✅ Working  

- Stats cards show real data (Total Tasks: 10, Completed: 2, In Progress: 3, Overdue: 1)
- "Tasks by Status" donut chart renders with interactive legend (todo: 5, in progress: 3, in review: 0, done: 2)
- "Tasks Completed (Last 30 Days)" line chart renders
- "Workload by Member" bar chart renders (DemoUser shown)
- "Overdue Tasks" section shows "Implement file upload system" (todo • low)
- "Your Workspaces" section shows "Demo Workspace" (owner)

**Issues:**
| ID | Issue | Severity | Description |
|----|-------|----------|-------------|
| DASH-01 | Overdue task not clickable | 🟠 Major | The overdue task "Implement file upload system" in the dashboard is not clickable/navigable. Users can't click to open the task detail. |
| DASH-02 | Charts show limited data | 🟡 Minor | "Tasks Completed (Last 30 Days)" only shows Feb 22 on X-axis, making the chart look sparse. |
| DASH-03 | Workspace card navigation | 🟡 Minor | Clicking "Demo Workspace" card doesn't navigate anywhere visible. |

---

### 4. Sidebar Navigation
**Status:** ⚠️ Partially Working  

- Sidebar renders with all navigation items (Home, Search, Sprints, Docs, Automations, Workload, Reports, Forms)
- Spaces tree shows "Product Development" → "Backend" → "API Development" hierarchy
- Collapse/expand sidebar works
- Workspace switcher present

**Issues:**
| ID | Issue | Severity | Description |
|----|-------|----------|-------------|
| NAV-01 | Sidebar nav buttons don't navigate | 🔴 Critical | Clicking sidebar items (Sprints, Docs, Automations, etc.) doesn't navigate to the correct page — the URL stays on `/dashboard`. The sidebar uses `router.push()` with workspace-specific URLs but the buttons appear to be firing navigation without the browser updating the route on first click. Subsequent clicks on space items just toggle expand/collapse instead of navigating. |
| NAV-02 | Space/Folder click = toggle only | 🟠 Major | Clicking a Space name only toggles expand/collapse, doesn't navigate to the Space page. Users must know to navigate via URL. Clicking "API Development" (list) doesn't navigate to the list view either. |
| NAV-03 | No active state highlighting | 🟡 Minor | Sidebar buttons don't visually indicate which page is currently active. |

---

### 5. List View (/dashboard/workspaces/{id}/spaces/{spaceId}/lists/{listId})
**Status:** ✅ Working  

- Task table renders with columns: Name, Status, Priority, Due Date, Assignee, List, Tags, Created, Updated
- 7 tasks visible with real data
- Status column shows colored status indicators (todo, done, in_progress)
- Priority badges work (Low, High, Urgent, Medium)
- Due dates shown properly (Feb 9 for overdue task)
- Assignee avatars show initials ("D" for Demo User)
- Inline "New task" input at bottom of list
- Checkbox selection column present

**Issues:**
| ID | Issue | Severity | Description |
|----|-------|----------|-------------|
| LIST-01 | Heading shows "List" not list name | 🟠 Major | The page heading shows generic "List" instead of the actual list name "API Development". Same for breadcrumb showing "Space" instead of "Product Development". |
| LIST-02 | Breadcrumb uses generic names | 🟠 Major | Breadcrumb shows "Workspace > Space > List" instead of "Demo Workspace > Product Development > API Development". |
| LIST-03 | "List" column shows "-" for all tasks | 🟡 Minor | The "List" column in the table header exists but shows "-" (dash) for every task. Should show list name or be removed. |
| LIST-04 | Tags column empty | 🟡 Minor | "Tags" column header exists but all tasks show no tags. Column takes up space. |
| LIST-05 | Group By / Sort / Filter toolbars | ✅ | Present and appear functional. "Group by: None", "Sort by: Due Date", "Filter" buttons visible. |
| LIST-06 | Test tasks with poor names | 🟡 Minor | Tasks named "New" and "Hi j" appear to be test data — consider cleaning demo data. |
| LIST-07 | Bulk actions | ⚠️ | Checkboxes present but no bulk action bar visible when selecting. |

---

### 6. Kanban Board View
**Status:** ✅ Working  

- Board renders with columns: To Do (3), In Progress (2), In Review (0), Done (2), Closed (0)
- Task cards show: title, description excerpt, priority badge, subtask count, overdue indicator, assignee avatar

- Empty columns show "Drop tasks here" placeholder

**Issues:**
| ID | Issue | Severity | Description |
|----|-------|----------|-------------|
| BOARD-01 | Drag and drop not verified | ⚠️ | Could not test drag-and-drop in headless browser. Implementation exists in code (uses DnD context). |
| BOARD-02 | Same header issues as List view | 🟠 Major | Heading still shows "List" instead of list name. |

---

### 7. Gantt View
**Status:** ⚠️ Placeholder

**Issues:**
| ID | Issue | Severity | Description |
|----|-------|----------|-------------|
| GANTT-01 | Gantt view is placeholder | 🟠 Major | Shows "Gantt View — Coming soon — timeline visualization for your tasks." No functionality implemented. |

---

### 8. Task Detail Panel (Inline + Full Page)
**Status:** ✅ Mostly Working  

Both inline slide-over panel (from list view) and full page view (/dashboard/workspaces/{id}/tasks/{taskId}) work.

**Working Features:**
- ✅ Task title editing (textbox)
- ✅ Status dropdown (combobox, shows "To Do" with color indicator)
- ✅ Priority dropdown (combobox, shows "Low" with color)

- ✅ Assignees (Shows "DU" avatar, "Add" button, remove button per assignee)
- ✅ Sprint assignment (dropdown showing "Sprint 1")
- ✅ Time tracking (0:00 display, play and stop buttons)
- ✅ Tags section ("Add tag" button)
- ✅ Custom Fields section (Story Points number input, Blocked toggle switch, "Add Field" button)
- ✅ Description (TipTap editor placeholder "Add a description...")
- ✅ Subtasks (Shows "0/1" counter, one subtask "Hi j" visible, "Add a subtask..." input, status change button)
- ✅ Dependencies section ("No dependencies set" text)

- ✅ Activity tab (All/Comments/History tabs, shows system events "created this task" and "changed status to To Do")
- ✅ Comments (Comment input with "Preview" and "Send" buttons, "No comments yet" when empty)
- ✅ Breadcrumb (shows "Product Dev... > API Develop... > Implement ...")
- ✅ "Back to List" button on full page view
- ✅ Delete and expand/open buttons in header
- ✅ "Collapse empty fields" toggle

**Issues:**
| ID | Issue | Severity | Description |
|----|-------|----------|-------------|
| TASK-01 | Attachment images return 500 | 🔴 Critical | File serving for attachments fails with 500 Internal Server Error. URLs like `/api/files/attachments/{taskId}/{fileId}.png` return 500. Attachment thumbnails are broken. |
| TASK-02 | Breadcrumb truncates names | 🔵 Cosmetic | "Product Dev..." and "API Develop..." and "Implement ..." are truncated in breadcrumb. Acceptable on small screens but could show full names or tooltip on hover. |
| TASK-03 | Assignee section overlaps dates visually | 🔵 Cosmetic | In the screenshot, the Assignees "DU" avatar floats near the Dates section, creating slight visual overlap. Layout could be cleaner. |
| TASK-04 | Activity shows "System" not user name | 🟡 Minor | Activity log shows "System" as the actor for all events instead of the actual user name. |
| TASK-05 | React key prop warning | 🟡 Minor | Console shows "Each child in a list should have a unique 'key' prop" in TaskDetailPanel. |
| TASK-06 | Description editor is placeholder only | 🟡 Minor | Shows "Add a description..." but clicking it to type was not tested (TipTap editor loaded). |
| TASK-07 | Dependencies section non-interactive | ⚠️ | Shows "No dependencies set" but no "Add dependency" button or interaction to add them. |

---

### 9. Sprint Pages
**Status:** ✅ Working  

**Sprint List (/dashboard/workspaces/{id}/sprints):**
- Tabs: Active (1), Planned (0), Completed (0)

- Burndown Chart (with Actual/Ideal lines)
- Sprint Board (mini Kanban with To Do, In Progress, In Review, Done columns)
- "Complete Sprint" button
- "Back" navigation button

**Issues:**
| ID | Issue | Severity | Description |
|----|-------|----------|-------------|
| SPRINT-01 | Sprint board task cards minimal | 🔵 Cosmetic | Sprint board task cards show only title and priority — less detail than main Kanban board. |
| SPRINT-02 | Burndown chart accuracy | ⚠️ | Burndown chart shows, but with only 1 task in sprint, data is minimal. Hard to verify correctness. |

---

### 10. Settings Page (/dashboard/settings)
**Status:** ✅ Working  

**Profile Tab:**
- Avatar URL input with preview (initials "D" shown)
- Full Name input (pre-filled "Demo User")

- Danger Zone: "Delete Account" button (disabled — good safety feature)

**Workspace Tab:**
- Workspace Name input (pre-filled "Demo Workspace")
- "Save Changes" button
- "Workspace Members" section shows "Member management coming soon"

**Issues:**
| ID | Issue | Severity | Description |
|----|-------|----------|-------------|

| SET-02 | No workspace deletion | 🟡 Minor | No way to delete workspaces. |
| SET-03 | Sign Out button placement | 🔵 Cosmetic | "Sign Out" button at bottom of settings is outside the tabbed content area — slightly awkward placement. |

---

**Status:** ✅ Working  

- Search dialog opens via button click in sidebar
- Keyboard shortcut Cmd+K registered in code
- Debounced search (300ms) calling `/api/search`
- Results categorized: Tasks and Docs
- Tested: typing "test" returned "Test" under Docs group

**Issues:**
| ID | Issue | Severity | Description |
|----|-------|----------|-------------|

---

### 12. Docs Page (/dashboard/workspaces/{id}/docs)
**Status:** ✅ Working (empty state)  

- Shows "Docs" heading with file icon
- "No documents yet — Create your first document to get started"
- "New Document" button present (in header and empty state)

**Issues:**

**Status:** ✅ Working (empty state)  

- Shows "Automations" heading with bot icon
- "No automations yet — Create your first automation to streamline your workflow"
- "Create Automation" button present

**Issues:**
| ID | Issue | Severity | Description |
|----|-------|----------|-------------|

---

### 14. Workload Page (/dashboard/workspaces/{id}/workload)
**Status:** ⚠️ Shows zero data  

- Shows stats cards: Total Members (0), Total Tasks (0), Completed (0)
- "No team data yet — Assign tasks to team members to see workload distribution"

**Issues:**
| ID | Issue | Severity | Description |
|----|-------|----------|-------------|
| WORK-01 | Shows 0 despite assigned tasks | 🟠 Major | Dashboard shows DemoUser in "Workload by Member" chart with tasks, but dedicated Workload page shows "Total Members: 0, Total Tasks: 0". Data mismatch or different API endpoints returning inconsistent results. |

---

---

## Global/Technical Issues

| ID | Issue | Severity | Description |
|----|-------|----------|-------------|
| GLOBAL-01 | SSE connection errors | 🔴 Critical | Recurring "SSE error: Event" in console (~every 15-30 seconds). The Server-Sent Events connection for real-time updates keeps failing and reconnecting. This generates constant error noise and may impact real-time features. |
| GLOBAL-02 | React hydration mismatch | 🟠 Major | Console shows hydration mismatch error for Radix UI DropdownMenu component (Radix ID mismatch between server and client render). This can cause UI inconsistencies. |
| GLOBAL-03 | API 500 errors with non-UUID IDs | 🟠 Major | All API endpoints crash with 500 when given non-UUID IDs (e.g., `/api/workspaces/1/spaces`). The DB uses UUID primary keys but the API doesn't validate ID format before querying, causing unhandled Drizzle/PostgreSQL errors. |
| GLOBAL-04 | No error boundaries for API failures | 🟡 Minor | When API calls fail (500/404), React Query retries silently. No user-facing error toast or message appears. |
| GLOBAL-05 | Next.js dev overlay visible | 🔵 Cosmetic | "Open Next.js Dev Tools" button and "Issues" badge visible in production. The app appears to be running in development mode. |
| GLOBAL-06 | No loading skeletons on navigation | 🔵 Cosmetic | Loading states exist in code but page transitions feel abrupt. |

---

## Summary of Critical Issues (Must Fix)

1. **AUTH-02: Register page missing** — Login page links to non-existent `/register`. New users can't sign up.
2. **TASK-01: Attachment file serving broken** — `/api/files/attachments/...` returns 500. Uploaded files can't be viewed.
3. **GLOBAL-01: SSE connection errors** — Real-time event stream constantly failing with errors every ~15-30 seconds.
4. **NAV-01: Sidebar navigation broken** — Clicking sidebar nav items doesn't navigate to the correct workspace-scoped URL.

## Summary of Major Issues (Should Fix)

1. **LIST-01/02, BOARD-02: Generic names in heading/breadcrumb** — "List", "Space", "Workspace" shown instead of actual names.
2. **GANTT-01: Gantt view placeholder** — "Coming soon" text only.
3. **SET-01: Member management placeholder** — Can't invite/manage team members.
4. **NAV-02: Space/folder/list navigation** — Sidebar items toggle instead of navigate.
5. **WORK-01: Workload data mismatch** — Shows 0 data despite tasks being assigned.
6. **GLOBAL-02: React hydration mismatch** — Radix UI ID inconsistency.
7. **GLOBAL-03: API crashes with invalid IDs** — No input validation on API endpoints.
8. **DASH-01: Overdue tasks not clickable** — Dashboard overdue task items not navigable.

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate (Pre-Launch)
1. Create a `/register` page or remove the "Sign up" link
2. Fix file serving for attachments (check MinIO/S3 configuration)
3. Fix SSE endpoint reliability or add graceful degradation
4. Fix sidebar navigation to use proper workspace-scoped URLs
5. Replace generic "List"/"Space"/"Workspace" headings with actual entity names from API data

### Short-Term
1. Add input validation on all API endpoints (UUID format check)
2. Fix React hydration mismatch for Radix UI components
3. Implement Gantt view or remove the tab
4. Add member management functionality
5. Fix Workload page to show correct data
6. Make dashboard overdue tasks clickable/navigable
7. Add `DialogTitle` to search CommandDialog for accessibility

### Polish
1. Switch to production mode (remove dev overlay)
2. Add loading skeletons and error feedback
3. Clean up demo data (remove "New" and "Hi j" test tasks)
4. Seed demo with richer sample data (docs, time entries, comments)
5. Add active state highlighting to sidebar navigation
6. Consider full-width breadcrumb names or tooltip on hover
