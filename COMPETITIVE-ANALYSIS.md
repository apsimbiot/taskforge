## Critical Missing Features (Must Implement)

### 1. Roadmap / Timeline View
**Priority: CRITICAL**  
**Why**: Roadmaps are essential for product teams to visualize feature releases, track progress, and communicate plans to stakeholders. Linear, ClickUp, Asana, and Monday all have this. Jira has roadmaps through Advanced Roadmaps.  
**Effort**: Medium-High (2-3 sprints)  
**Recommendation**: Implement a Gantt-style timeline view grouped by projects/initiatives with drag-to-reschedule.

---

### 2. Goals / OKRs
**Priority: CRITICAL**  
**Why**: Goal tracking is a top-requested enterprise feature. Asana, Monday, and ClickUp make this central to their value proposition. Without goals, TaskForge can't compete for enterprise accounts.  
**Effort**: Medium (2 sprints)  
**Recommendation**: Add a Goals module where teams can create objectives, key results linked to tasks, and progress dashboards.

---

### 3. Project Templates
**Priority: CRITICAL**  
**Why**: Templates accelerate onboarding and ensure consistency. Every competitor has them. This is a basic expectation for any project management tool.  
**Effort**: Low-Medium (1-2 sprints)  
**Recommendation**: Allow saving any project/folder/list as a template, and provide pre-built templates (Agile Sprint, Bug Tracking, Marketing Campaign, etc.).

---

### 4. Public API
**Priority: CRITICAL**  
**Why**: Enterprise customers need integrations. Without a public API, TaskForge can't connect to their existing toolchains. Linear's API-first approach is a major competitive advantage.  
**Effort**: Medium (2 sprints)  
**Recommendation**: Implement a REST API covering CRUD for workspaces, projects, tasks, comments with proper authentication (API keys + OAuth).

---

### 5. Task Dependencies (Blocking/Blocked By)
**Priority: HIGH**  
**Why**: Critical for project planning. Users need to show that Task A blocks Task B. This is fundamental for managing complex projects.  
**Effort**: Low (1 sprint)  
**Recommendation**: Add a "Related Tasks" or "Dependencies" section in task detail with "blocks" and "blocked by" relationships.

---

### 6. Calendar View
**Priority: HIGH**  
**Why**: Common expectation for task management. Visualizing tasks on a calendar helps with capacity planning and deadline management.  
**Effort**: Medium (1-2 sprints)  
**Recommendation**: Implement a calendar view showing tasks with due dates, similar to Google Calendar or ClickUp's Calendar view.

---

## High Value Missing Features

### 7. Recurring Tasks
**Priority: HIGH**  
**Why**: Many workflows involve recurring work (weekly syncs, monthly reports). This is a basic PM tool expectation.  
**Effort**: Low (1 sprint)

---

### 8. Threaded Comments
**Priority: HIGH**  
**Why**: Enables better discussion threading. Linear, Notion, and Jira all support this. Currently TaskForge has flat comments.  
**Effort**: Low (1 sprint)

---

### 9. Guest / External User Access
**Priority: HIGH**  
**Why**: Teams frequently need to collaborate with contractors, clients, or partners outside the organization.  
**Effort**: Medium (1-2 sprints)

---

### 10. Import from Other Tools
**Priority: MEDIUM**  
**Why**: Migration path is essential. Users want to move from Jira/Asana/ClickUp/Linear.  
**Effort**: Medium (1-2 sprints)  
**Recommendation**: Support CSV import and direct import from Linear/Asana/Jira APIs.

---

### 11. Mobile App / PWA
**Priority: MEDIUM**  
**Why**: Mobile access is expected. Linear's mobile app is a key differentiator.  
**Effort**: High (2-3 sprints)  
**Recommendation**: Start with PWA support, then native mobile app.

---

### 12. Integrations (GitHub, Slack, Calendar)
**Priority: MEDIUM**  
**Why**: Development teams expect GitHub integration. Slack integration is universal.  
**Effort**: Medium (2 sprints per integration)  
**Recommendation**: Prioritize GitHub (sync issues/PRs), then Slack (notifications), then Calendar (2-way sync).

---

### 13. Advanced Search / Semantic Search
**Priority: MEDIUM**  
**Why**: Linear's semantic search is a standout feature. Users want to find tasks by meaning, not just keywords.  
**Effort**: Medium-High

---

### 14. Burndown Charts
**Priority: MEDIUM**  
**Why**: Essential for Agile teams to track sprint progress.  
**Effort**: Low (1 sprint)

---

### 15. Workload Heatmaps / Advanced Resource Management
**Priority: MEDIUM**  
**Why**: Better workload visualization helps prevent burnout and overallocation.  
**Effort**: Medium

### Key AI Gaps for TaskForge

1. **AI Agents**: Linear and ClickUp have AI teammates that can work autonomously. This is the biggest AI differentiator.

2. **Smart Triage**: Linear's Triage Intelligence automatically suggests assignees, labels, and projects based on historical patterns.

3. **Duplicate Detection**: Linear identifies similar issues to prevent duplicates.

4. **Semantic Search**: AI-powered search that understands context, not just keywords.

5. **AI Summaries**: Automated daily/weekly digests of project progress.

6. **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**: Linear's MCP server allows AI tools (Cursor, Claude, ChatGPT) to interact with Linear programmatically. This is a developer-focused advantage.

## Summary

TaskForge has a strong foundation but lacks several critical enterprise features. The **most urgent additions** are:

1. **Roadmap/Timeline** - Essential for product teams
2. **Goals/OKRs** - Enterprise requirement  
3. **Templates** - Basic expectation
4. **Public API** - Integration enablement
5. **Dependencies** - Project planning fundamental

For AI, TaskForge should move beyond basic task generation toward **AI agents**, **smart triage**, and **semantic search** to compete with Linear and ClickUp.
